# asm_functions

There will probably be a library soon, instead of some functions and a main.		
￼ Every names seems explicit to me, and already exist, so they can be found in C doc. Except possibly the asm_write() function, present in ./asm/asm_writeData.s.		
￼
￼ The purpose of this function is to open a file using the first parameter as name and write the content of the second parameter into it. It also return the number of characters of the string written in the file.
