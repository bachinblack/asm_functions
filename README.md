# asm_functions

This project was originally a school project.
There are, in this repository, 12 asm (intel) functions along with a makefile to compile them with a C main.
Most of these functions are from standard libC, except asm_add (function to add two int) and asm_writeData (function that will open a file, write some text in it and close it).
